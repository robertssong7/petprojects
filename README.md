<h1 align="center">Robert Song — CreativeLab</h1>

<p align="center">
  CreativeLab is my personal space for building simple, fast, and useful interactive tools. 
  These projects reflect how I learn by creating things and exploring ideas in product design, 
  clear user interfaces, and practical problem solving. 
  Each project is intentionally lightweight and approachable, designed to turn small ideas into 
  something people can use right away.

### <a href="https://robertssong7.github.io/CreativeLab/bar/" target="_blank">🍹 Bar Wizard</a>

Bar Wizard helps you turn whatever ingredients you already have into structured, cocktail-ready recipes. No bartending experience needed.  

It uses a simple “pantry” system that is modifiable, remembers what you have available, and suggests drinks based on ratios, flavor profiles, and classic cocktail structures.

**Use it to:**  
- Discover new drink ideas with ingredients on hand  
- Learn the foundations of cocktail structure (sour, old fashioned, highball, and more)
- Host friends with more variety and less prep
